# Introduction

RMI is a protocol that allows for communication or message passing
between remote servers. RMI is often implemented for secure messaging
using only port information. In this set of programs, I have implemented
RMI in Java in order to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph or
set of graphs.

MST or minimum spanning tree is that tree of least weight in an
undirected graph that covers each and every node in the graph. There are
two main greedy algorithms used to implement MSTs:

* Prim's Algorithm, and
* Kruskal's Algorithm

Prim's has been implemented for this assignment.
